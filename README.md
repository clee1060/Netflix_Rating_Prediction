# Netflix_Rating_Prediction
Here are the Jupyter Notebooks that we used in order to create our models for the DSCI 303 Final Project.
* Data_Preparation: Creates the cleaned data subset that we use for the other notebooks. Run this first with a data_folder directory in the root directory.
* KNN_Netflix: Contains the code used for KNN.
* Collaborative_Filtering_Netflix: Contains the code used for Collaborative Filtering.

# How to run
The data itself was too large to upload to Github. So, to run, go to https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data and download the dataset. Put all of these files into a folder at the base level called "data_folder." Then, you should be able to run all of the notebooks.
